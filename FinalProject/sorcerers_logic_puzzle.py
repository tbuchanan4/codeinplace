"""
Sorcerer's Logic Puzzle:
This program will let the player reason their way through the potion logic puzzle that Harry & Hermione face and that
Hermione solves in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (also known as the Philosopher's Stone for those of
differing geographies).

Some notes on future improvements:
-The code in general could certainly be structured better. It's very heavy in main() and should instead be broken out into other functions where possible
-Sound does not currently loop
-Would like reset button to also respond to a click of Button-1. Was having trouble with that click interfering with general operation when it was intially assigned as such so I changed to Button-3
-Rather than operating via independent if statements, I'd like getxy() to function via a branching decision tree that responds differently based on the object clicked.
